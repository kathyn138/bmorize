# bmorize

bmorize is a matching card game that users can use to practice their memorization skills.
There are three levels (easy, difficult, and hard) for users to choose from.

bmorize was created in x days as part of the Hiring Hackathon for Junior Web Developers hosted by [Mintbean](https://mintbean.io/). 

bmorize is live on [Netlify](link here).
